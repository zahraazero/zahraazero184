<center><p>Assalamualaikum everyone. My name is Siti Fatimah Zahra binti Azero, you can
know me more in the biodata section üòâ Honestly, I'm just a normal girl who have a normal 
life like everyone else but to be honest I need to admit myself that sometimes I'm not normal. If you
know what I mean, you will know it especially if you're a friend of mine üò¨ You guys should
really guess my age because I'm totally not going to tell my age here HAHAHA sorryyy. 
Alhamdulillah, I'm 2* years old now (guess my age first okay!!), and alhamdulillah I get
to proceed my Degree in UiTM Kedah in Library Management. Also alhamdulillah, at this moment
everything went well but sometimes going through some stress is normal too right eventhough
we're at home because everyone struggles the same thing as a child of their parents. As for
me I can say that I am the #anakharapan at home because I'm the only girl and that my 
parents rely much things on me at home so I guess there's nothing to say about it, everyone 
feels the same thing HAHAHA okay so you can definitely know me more by reading my biodata as
I tell everything about me there. For my website, I use the theme of pink because I love
pink sooooo much that I think it suits me really well hehe. Please have fun in reading 
my website! Thankyou So Much! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p></center>

<justify><p>As for this one, I would really love to make an appreciation post that I should
have made for my parents. They have sacrifies almost everything they could have done for 
their children which is definitely I am one of their babies hehe. I am beyond grateful for 
that. Now that I am old enough, I know what I should aim and that, in life, I just want to 
make my parents happy with everything I do. I just want to give them happiness like what they 
are doing to me right now. I want to be a very successful person and so that I can manage to
be excellent in everything I do and give them the best I could. I want to be the best of 
me and give my parents gifts as much as I could as long as I'm still alive. I really want to
make them happy in this life and in the Hereafter ‚ù§Ô∏è May Allah give me the chance to do 
everything for my parents, aamiin ‚ù§Ô∏è</p></justify></td>

<justify><p>Next appreciation post is to my siblings. Alhamdulillah, honestly I am more than
thankful for having all six of my brothers eventhough honestly all of my brother are sooooo 
annoying when I was small. Now that we are all grown bigger, I miss them more that I could 
have been missing them. As I grow older and as they are married, I love my brothers even
more and thank you for being there with me when I needed you. Honestly, having many brothers
are not a good and as bad as people expected HAHAHAHAHA mean words but still, that's the
truth hehe. After having sisters-in-law, my brothers do have some sense towards me as their
lil sister and also loving sis-in-laws. I love them so much!! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p></justify></td>
